Web Development Fellowship @ Oasis Infobyte

This repository showcases the project I completed as part of my Web Development Fellowship at *Oasis Infobyte*. Each task reflects foundational concepts in frontend development using HTML and CSS.
Task 1: Landing Page

Designed and developed a fully responsive landing page using HTML and CSS.
This project allowed me to apply key design principles such as layout structuring, color coordination, and content alignment to build a clean and engaging interface.

Highlights:

* Header and footer implementation
* Well-structured content sections
* Thoughtful use of colors and spacing
* Responsive across different screen size
